i never really thought anyone else would ever see this code so i didnt comment like an idiot
so i probably have to explain why it exists and what it does
1)why does it exist:
i was board one day and i was coding a really bad c# app then i realized i could just automate it
even just a little bit
2)what does it do:
it can make skeletons of a basic c# application
	2.5)why?:
		because fuck you thats why
3)america explain:
ok so it writes to the file with the extension of .cs in the syntax of c# in a loop
it can check how many brackets you need to add
you can still fuck up so be wary

so yeah thats it (this was mainly an experement and could be done alot better
